# List of base images to update on Leonhard Cloud.
#
# For each image, the following attributes are mandatory:
# - `name` (a human readable string for display purposes)
# - `uuid` (OpenStack image ID) or `source` (download URL for VM image in RAW or QCOW2 fmt)
# - `user` (username to use when connecting over SSH)
#
# The following attributes are optional:
# - `extra_plays`: list of additional playbooks to execute on host
# - `extra_prefix`: a string that is prefixed to the VM snapshot name
# - `format`: format of the downloaded image (any string that can be passed to
#   `qemu-img`'s `-f` option; `qcow2` is the default)
#
# Combined, the first two optional attributes allow the creation of VM images
# that run additional customization on top of base images.
#
# Additional attributes are allowed but will be ignored.
