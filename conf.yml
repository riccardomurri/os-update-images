# List of base images to update on UZH Science Cloud.
#
# For each image, the following attributes are mandatory:
# - UUID
# - username to use when connecting over SSH
#
# The following attributes are optional:
# - `extra_plays`: list of additional playbooks to execute on host
# - `extra_prefix`: a string that is prefixed to the VM snapshot name
# Combined, the two optional attributes allow the creation of VM images
# that run additional customization on top of base images.
#
# Additional attributes are allowed but will be ignored.
